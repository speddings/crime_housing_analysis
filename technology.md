## Data Cleaning and Analysis
### Python, Pandas, and uszipcode module were used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis in Jupyter Notebook. 

## Database Storage
### SQL is the database we have used for data storage. Our data will be displayed with Tableau. SQLAlchemy is used to interact between the database (SQL) and Jupyter Notebook.

## Machine Learning
### SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We plan to start with Random Forest Classifer as it does well with a large number of features and is less likely to be overfitted than neural networks. If time allows we will utilize neural networks also.

## Dashboard
### We plan to use Tableau to visualize our data and tell our data story.

## Presentation
### Google slides will be used for the presentation.
