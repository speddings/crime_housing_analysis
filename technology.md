# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
### Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
### Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will display our data with Tableau.

## Machine Learning
### SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is neural networks. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
### We plan to use Tableau to visualize our data and tell our data story.
