# Crime Housing Analysis

## Week 1
### Assigned Roles
* Square - Shannon - repo owner
* Circle - Lee - mockup of a database with a set of sample data
* Triangle - Kyle - mockup of machine learning model
* X - Afton - technologies

### Communication
#### We will primarily be communicating in our slack group. Lee and Shannon are available weeknights and weekends. Kyle is available evenings Sat, M, W, Th. Afton does not have a set schedule but will meet up as needed.

### Seclected Topic
#### Crime Housing Analysis
##### We will be trying to predict crime rates based off of house prices and education level.

### Reason for Selected Topic
#### We wanted to try to do something a little different while working with datasets we would be able to understand without extensive research due to time constraints. We also wanted to pick datasets that would allow for visualizations for the final presentation.

#### Description of the Source of Data
#### Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

#### Questions We Hope to Answer Through Our Analysis
* Which zip codes have the highest crime?
* Which zip codes have the lowest crime?
* Can we predict crime rates based on housing prices and education levels in U.S.?
* What areas may be at risk for high crimes in U.S.?
