# Crime Housing Analysis

## Week 1
### Assigned Roles
* Square - Shannon - repository owner
* Circle - Lee - mockup of a database(basic schema)
* Triangle - Kyle - mockup of machine learning model
* X - Afton - technologies

### Communication
#### We will primarily be communicating in our slack group. Lee and Shannon are available weeknights and weekends. Kyle is available evenings Sat, M, W, Th. Afton does not have a set schedule but will meet up as needed. Trello will be used to stay on task and meet deadlines.

### Seclected Topic
#### Crime and Wildfire Housing Analysis
##### We will be looking at the impact of wildfires and crime on housing prices in CA.

### Reason for Selected Topic
#### We wanted to try to do something a little different while working with datasets we would be able to understand without extensive research due to time constraints. We also wanted to pick datasets that would allow for visualizations for the final presentation.
